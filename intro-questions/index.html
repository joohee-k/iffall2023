        <h1>Introductory questions</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Joohee Kim. I'm majoring in communication design and minoring in Drama. I'm a junior.</p>

        <p>2. I'm from Busan, South Korea. My interest in design and art has changed a lot over the past few years. I was and am very enthusiastic about fine arts, especially oil painting. I grew to be more interested in graphic design and illustration as well. My most recent interests are film and video production.
            This class was a mandatory, but I wanted to take this class as it will help me learn essential skills that I will use in video production and graphic design industry.
        </p>
        <p>3. I have very minimal experience with HTML/CSS/JS. 
            I did one assignment in Typography I where I created a HTML page for my article, and it involved a very minimal CSS code.</p>
        <p> 4. I hope to learn how to make interactive websites that I can upload my artworks on.</p>
        <p> 5. I think that designing for screen is different in that it should account for the different screens that the viewers will be using. </p>
        <p> 6. <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> is a website that I find effective, because of how it represents the company values very well in the design and UI/UX. It is minimal and straightforward, yet visually pleasing. </p>
        <p> 7. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> is effective in communicating its functions and services to the users. I can easily navigate in youtube because of its simple color theme, icons and menu bar. What the website does is very clear as all the recommended videos pop up when you get into the website, and the searching bar is in clear sight.</p>
        <p> 8. <a href="https://www.unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> is a website that I frequently use for stock images. I think that this website is very easy to navigate and is very accomodating to the user's needs.</p>
