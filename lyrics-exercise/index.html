            <h4>[Verse 1]</h4>
            <p>
                Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
                <br>
                Whistlin' my name
                <br>
                Open up a beer, and you say, "Get over here
                <br>
                And play a video game"
                <br>
                I'm in his favourite sundress, watching me get undressed
                <br>
                Take that body downtown
                <br>
                I say, "You the bestest", lean in for a big kiss
                <br>
                Put his favourite perfume on
                <br>
                "Go play your video game"
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>[Pre-Chorus]</h4>
            <p>
                It's you, it's you, it's all for you
                <br>
                Everything I do
                <br>
                I tell you all the time
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
            <p>
                Heaven is a place on earth with you
                <br>
                Tell me all the things you wanna do
                <br>
                I heard that you like the bad girls, honey
                <br>
                Is that true?
                <br>
                It's better than I ever even knew
                <br>
                They say that the world was built for two
                <br>
                Only worth living if somebody is loving you
                <br>
                And baby, now you do
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>[Verse 2]</h4>
            <p>
                Singin' in the old bars, swingin' with the old stars
                <br>
                Livin' for the fame
                <br>
                Kissin' in the blue dark, playin' pool and wild darts
                <br>
                Video games
                <br>
                He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
                <br>
                This is all I think of
                <br>
                Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
                <br>
                This is my idea of fun
                <br>
                Playin' video games
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>[Pre-Chorus]</h4>
            <p>
                It's you, it's you, it's all for you
                <br>
                Everything I do
                <br>
                I tell you all the time
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>[Chorus]</h4>
            <p>
                Heaven is a place on earth with you
                <br>
                Tell me all the things you wanna do

            <h4>[Pre-Chorus]</h4>
            <p>
                It's you, it's you, it's all for you
                <br>
                Everything I do
                <br>
                I tell you all the time
