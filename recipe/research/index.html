        <h1> Blueberry Pancakes</h1>
            <p>Blueberry pancakes are a wonderful treat when fresh blueberries are in season. But don't limit your enjoyment of these tender, golden cakes to summer; frozen blueberries make them a year-round treat.</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>

                <li>1 cup milk</li>           
                <li>1 egg</li>           
                <li>½ tablespoon butter, melted</li>
                <li>½ cup frozen blueberries, thawed</li>
            </ul>

                <li>Combine milk and egg in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Stir egg mixture into flour mixture until just combined.</li>
                <li>Stir in melted butter, then fold in blueberries.</li>
                <li>Set aside for 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the hot griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles appear on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown on both sides. Serve hot.</li>

        <h2>Three Links to Recipe Websites</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20177/todds-famous-blueberry-pancakes/">Todd's Famous Blueberry Pancakes</a> from Allrecipes</li>
            <p>This website is short and sweet and easy to navigate. There are all the essential buttons, such as "save" and "print" buttons at the top, and a nice box for the facts such as prep time, cook time, and servings. There is a embedded youtube video to follow along the recipe and a photo gallery of actual people's results. The directions were a little too simple and not as friendly to baking beginners, as the steps are reduced to three long directions without any photos.</p>
            <li><a href="https://pinchofyum.com/fluffiest-blueberry-pancakes">Fluffiest Blueberry Pancakes</a> from Pinch of Yum</li>
            <p>This website has video references for each step, which makes it more friendly and appealing to the novice readers, including me. There is also a checkbox that allows you to tick all the ingredients off on the website, making it easier for the reader to shop for ingredients. "Print Recipe" button can also be useful. I am also glad to see the equipment needed at the bottom. However, the downside is that you have to scroll through a long article before you get to the recipe. Even though there is a "jump to recipe" button, it makes the website harder to navigate.</p>
            <li><a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/blueberry-pancakes-recipe">Bluberry Pancakes</a> from King Arthur Baking</li>
            <p>This website isn't one of the first ones that come up when I type in "Blueberry Pancakes", yet I felt like the layout was clean and straightforward. This website feels more beginner friendly, as it provides alternative options for ingredients and equipments. Even though this website was missing punctuations from time to time, it is able to come across as more personal and 'human' by putting "tips from our bakers" section and "chat with a baker" option. One downside of this website would be the ingredients, where it just promotes their own products like vanilla extract or flour.</p>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Three Links to Non-Recipe Websites</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="https://plunderandpoach.webflow.io/">DONÜTS</a></li>
            <p>This colorful website is incredibly fun to navigate with its many interactions. There are so many hover and scrolling effects. All of the photographs in this website either has a very simple color background or it does not have one. This allows me to focus on each of the photographs. The website uses yellow and pink for its background and black for its type - which is quite simple. However, it uses three additional accent colors on type to make the website seem much more fun and lighthearted. This website also combines its type and images in a very intentional and harmonious way, which I want to incorporate in my project.</p>

            <li><a href="https://blog.pommaker.com/">Pom Maker</a></li>
            <p>The Pom Pom tutorials are very easy to follow, and I think that I will try to follow this website's design language the most in my project. Even though it is not a food recipe, it is a how-to website on how to make cute pom pom objects. The website starts with a high-quality image of the finished product. Then, there is a neatly organized photograph of all the equipments with the description in the same order. In the instructions, there are photographs accompanied with the description to make the steps extra clear. I also really appreciated the large type size, which made it easier for the eye.</p>

            <li><a href="https://swabtheworld.com/en/">Locomotive-Swab The World </a></li>
            <p>The bright color palette of this website really grabbed my eye. I want to use different sections with different design motives like this one in my recipe website. This one is similar to the DONÜTS website in many ways, however, it retains a more professional look with a limited color palette and the consistency of the arrangement of its paragraphs. The horizontal lines and color blocking separates the sections very well.</p>
